## Bitcoin, the underlying global monetary network

Over the years, Bitcoin has continually proven itself as a robust asset that can be transferred instantly for a low fee
over the Lightning Network. Bitcoin also proved that we can have an independent monetary policy that can't be
manipulated by anyone : "Rules without rulers".

Thanks to its proof of work mechanism, we now have a very strong & autonomous system that can't be destroyed unless all
countries decides to suppress electricity, computers or Internet.

Despite inflation, the U.S. dollar remains an attractive store of value and unit of account. Let's face it, Bitcoin is
an excellent store of value that provides unique properties (censorship resistant, scarcity, easy to move...) but going
100% into bitcoin is risky. It is less attractive than the dollar for businesses and individuals in many circumstances.

but here comes Taro (Taproot Asset Representation Overlay), it's a protocol that allows people to issue digital assets
on the Bitcoin blockchain (like a stable coin or an NFT).

Concretely, what does this means ? anybody, by creating a simple Bitcoin transaction, can mint arbitrary assets on the
Bitcoin blockchain. Those assets can be transferred with a classical Bitcoin transaction, or an off-chain transaction
over the Lightning Network.

Here are some things you could do :

- Banks are sometimes expensive and are not available to anyone. You could gather a group of businesses / peoples
  exchanging USD regularly. You lock all that money in a classical bank account, and you issue with Taro, the equivalent
  amount of BitcoinUSD (name it like you want). This community can now store, transfer and exchange money without using
  the banks !

- A community could create its own currency. Managed directly by the peoples using it. This community could even start
  to issue bonds.

- Commodities producer (oil, coal, gold...) coud create claims for their commodities.

- A concert organizer could create tickets for a concert and sell them directly throw the lighting network.

Our vision is that Bitcoin (with Lighting network) is the most open, secure, and robust monetary infrastructure. With
Taro, this infrastructure can become a global monetary network that allows anyone to receive, store and send any
currency or asset.
