      content: "Bitcoin is a form of digital cash that eliminates the need for central authorities such as banks or
                governments or any central authority. This means money flows directly from the sender to the receiver, 
                and it is never held or controlled by a third party in between. \n\n

                Nobody independently owns or controls Bitcoin, so everyone can participate in the network and no one can
                stop, forbid or erase any transaction. You are sovereign on your Bitcoin, nobody can set any limit on 
                what you can do with the bitcoins you own. \n\n

                Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy is also independent as the total bitcoin’s supply has been limited to 21 
                million Bitcoins. New Bitcoins are created approximately every 10 minutes (Right now there is almost 18 
                million Bitcoin in circulation)."

      content: "Bitcoin’s blockchain can only process an average of 7 transactions per second and, for several excellent
                reasons, it would not be a good idea to raise the number of transactions stored every 10 minutes. Just
                imagine the costs of storing 150 million transactions per day like visa does... \n\n
                
                The Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol designed to enable Bitcoin transactions which are not
                recorded on the blockchain. Because they are not recorded on the blockchain, and thus require no mining,
                Lightning payments are extremely fast and cheap. \n\n
                
                Alice, Bob and Carole are brothers and sisters. They often refund each other (restaurants, presents,
                loans...). Using Bitcoin for this would be a terrible idea as, for each transaction, they will have to 
                pay high fees. Lighting network has been invented for cases like this one! this is a very simple and
                very incomplete explanation of how it works :  \n\n
                - Alice, Bob and Carole will create a bitcoin transaction to lock some bitcoins. \n
                - Alice creates a transaction to refund Carole for the parent's present she bought and give it to Carole. \n
                - Bob creates a transaction to refund Carole for the parent's present she bought and give it to Carole. \n
                - Alice creates a transaction to refund Bob for the Carole's present he bought. \n
                - They can do that as long as they want... transactions are never sent the blockchain. \n
  
                With the lighting network, the balance of Alice, Bob and Carole evolve off-chain with each transaction
                they exchange privately. At any moment, anyone can publish a closing transaction to write in the
                blockchain the final balance of Alice, Bob and Carole."
